# XION-ChaseCam with Custom Firmware 
This is a free-to-use HTML/javascript based overlay for roleplay streamers.  Basically it mimics the overlay of the AXON bodycam, but since most folks play in 3rd person, it's a ChaseCam.  I've included a logo, and the html file.  The html file has the css, html, and javascript all in one file for ease of editing.  Edit whatever you want I have comments important stuff that you want to change.
